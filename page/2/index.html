                <a class="post-title" href="http://kayladnls.com/2014/12/11/machine-learning">Intro to Machine Learning: Math and Magic and Power.</a>

                <div class="post-content">
                    <div class="text-editor">
                        <p>Welcome to the first post in a new Machine Learning Series I'll be writing. We'll start from the top, covering what machine learning is at the most basic level. Each post will cover another topic, giving a more in depth view of key concepts and ideas.</p>

<h4>Machine Learning: What even is it?</h4>

<p>Machine learning. What do you think of when you hear that? If you're like most people (or at least like me) you think of SkyNet. Sentient computers that take over the world and enslave all of mankind.</p>

<p>Really, though, what Machine learning really is: MATH. Math, and magic and a whole lot of power. If you're already having horribly flashbacks to Calculus class, don't run away screaming just yet. Focus more on the "magic" and "power" parts. The math will come, I promise.</p>

<p>If you spend any time on the internet at all, you probably come into contact with dozens of services a day that use some form of machine learning. Do you use Gmail or a similar service that automatically detects "spam" for you and filters it out of your inbox? Are you on twitter right now, staring at a list of "Suggested" accounts for you to follow?</p>

<p>Both of those are examples of Machine Learning in action.</p>

<p>**Textbook Definition: **</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Machine learning is a scientific discipline that explores the construction and study of algorithms that can learn from data.[1]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Machine learning is about understanding data, and drawing conclusions from that data. There is a vast array of tools (algorithms) available to us to help us do that. The magic of these algorithms? They do all the work.</p>

<p>These algorithms are given a <strong>training dataset</strong> to learn from. Their accuracy is then run against a <strong>test dataset</strong> to confirm that they are performing well. Once that is done, you can feel relatively safe running the algorithm against real world data.</p>

<p>Think of both the training and test datasets as "past experiences". You're giving your algorithm a set of past experiences and telling it to learn from it. You can then hand it a "new experience", and based on what it has learned, it will predict the outcome for you.</p>

<h4>What can you do with it?</h4>

<p>There are two main types of Machine Learning (also called Statistical Learning): <strong>Supervised</strong> and <strong>Unsupervised</strong>.  I'll explain both breifly, and we'll go into more depth in future posts in this series.</p>

<h5>Supervised</h5>

<p>Supervised statistical learning methods build a statistical model for predicting or estimating output based on input(s). Within the field of supervised learning, there are two more clasifications: Those algorithms that give continuous,  quantitative output and those that give non-numeric or categorical (qualitative) output.</p>

<p>A common form of quantitative supervised learning is called <strong>Regression</strong>. 
**Example: **We have a dataset of <code>WageData</code> that includes information about the age, education, wage and calendar year of men in a specific area of the country. We can use a regression algorithm to create a model such that, given another man's information, we can accurately predict his wages.</p>

<p>A common form of qualitative supervised is <strong>Classification</strong>.<br />
<strong>Example:</strong> By examining stock market data containing daily movements in the S&amp;P 500 over a 5 year period, we are able to predict whether tomorrow's index will <em>increase</em> or <em>decrease</em>.  (PS: This is very hard to do, so don't get your hopes up that this series will teach you to become a Wall Street bajillionaire.)</p>

<h5>Unsupervised</h5>

<p>Unsupervised methods have input, but no output. Instead, we're trying to learn about the structure of the data, and relationships within that data. In this case, we're not trying to predict or estimate, but observe.</p>

<p>A common type of Unsupervised learning is called <strong>Clustering</strong>. 
<strong>Example</strong> Given market demographics for customers of our company (age, Annual house hold income, etc) we can analyze the data and find "groupings" or "clusters" within the data. Further analysis of those clusters can help us understand how each group is related to the other.</p>

<p>So, there you have it. A quick, preliminary rundown of what Machine Learning is. More to come!</p>

                        <h4>"Have you ever heard of Rule 30?"</h4>

<p>A friend chirped me in skype asking if I was familiar with "Rule 30". He's going in for a job interview and they'd asked him to code this Rule 30 as an exercise. I hadn't heard of it, but I was intruiged, and I'm always one to try to help a friend. Off to the Google-Mobile, Batman!</p>

<p>As I would learn, <code>Rule 30</code> refers to something introduced by  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Wolfram">Stephen Wolfram</a> in 1983]<sup> (1)</sup>.  Even if you're not familiar with Wolfram, you're probably familiar with his work. Especially, if you took any <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/">college level Calculus classes</a>. He was a computer scientist, and word is he was pretty good at the maths. If you don't know him, check him out, cool dude.</p>

<p>Anyway, on to this Rule 30 business. Rule 30 is one of many rules that pertains to binary cellular automaton<sup> (2)</sup>. Now, when I read that the first time, they lost me halfway through binary. If you're like me, never fear!</p>

<h4>Elementary Celluar Automaton</h4>

<p>So, how's this work? For each cell there are two possible values: 1 or 0. Each of Wolfram's "Rules" (there are 255 of them) defines a list of rules that tell you how to determine whether a given cell is 1 or 0. It does this by analyzing the "neghborhood" of the cell in question. What is meant by neighborhood is discussed in more detail below.</p>

<h4>What it means to be 1D</h4>

<p>You may be famliar with other Cellular Automata, such as Conway's game of life Game of Life<sup>(3)</sup>. This method is similar, but there is a primary difference. Game of Life is 2-dimensional, with a third dimension of time. That means that as the rules are applied and the pattern progresses, the "board" is refreshed.</p>

<p>Rule 30 and it's siblings are 1-Dimensional. In this case, the y axis is, in fact, time. That means that as the program is run the new output is appended to the old, rather than the entire "board" refreshing.</p>

<h4>Why "Rule 30"?</h4>

<p>Since there are<code>2×2×2 = 8</code> possible binary states for the three cells neighboring a given cell, there are a total of <code>2^8=256</code> elementary cellular automata, each of which can be indexed with an 8-bit binary number.</p>

<p>So, Binary: 00011110 = decimal 30. Therefore, Rule 30. This holds true for all of the other rules, too, by the way. Not terribly important, but I found it interesting, so there you have it. Moving on.</p>

<h4>Ruleception</h4>

<p>Yes! Rules inside rules!</p>

<p><img src="/img/rule30.gif" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Above are the rules given for Rule 30. This is how you determine whether your "cell" is a 1 or a 0. Upon first inspection, this made absolutely 0 sense to me. (binary pun possibly intended?).</p>

<p>What you need to understand here is what is meant by "neighborhood". When you're determining the 1/0ness of a cell, you look at it's neighborhood and compare that against the rules. Neighborhood being the three cells above it. So, 111 = 0, 110 = 0, so forth and so on. Once you get your mind around that, you're off to the races.</p>

<p>Once you have your rules, you apply them to the given input (in this case a single "line" of the grid with at least one cell set to "1"). What do you get?</p>

<p><img src="/img/rule30graph.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>So Pretty.</p>

<p>But how do you DO it? Well, let me show you.</p>

<h4>The Codez.</h4>

<p>*** Warning!** I have absolutely no intention of using OO practices here. No classes will be made, no injection will be used. I will interface nothing. If this makes you uncomfortable, you may want to stop reading.*</p>

<p>End result, I want to create this cool looking graph thing. That's how a picture it, a graph, or grid, Once you're there, it becomes a matter of some setup, and then some iteration. It looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>//First thing's first, let's codify those rules. 
$rules = array(
    '111'=&gt; 0,
    '110' =&gt; 0,
    '101'=&gt; 0,
    '100' =&gt; 1,
    '011'=&gt; 1,
    '010' =&gt; 1,
    '001'=&gt; 1,
    '000' =&gt; 0
);

//create an empty array to hold your grid
$lines = array();

//set up that first line 
$first_line = array_fill(0, 51, 0);

// make sure you set at least one of those cells to 1,
// or this will going no where fase. 
$first_line[24] = 1;

//now add your line to the grid. 
$lines[] = $first_line;

//Lets compile that grid

// I'm doing 10 iterations, you can do as many as you like. 
for ($i = 0; $i&lt; 10; $i++)
{
    // make a new line
    $line = array();

    for($j = 0; $j&lt; 51; $j++)
    {
        // The "pattern" is determined by the "neighborhood" or the 3 cells in the 
        // generation (row) above our cell in question. 
        $pattern = (string)implode('', array_slice(end($lines), $j - 1, 3));

         // if we have a valid value, great. Elsewise, give is a 0. 
         $line[] = (strlen($pattern) == 3 &amp;&amp; isset($rules[$pattern])) ? $rules[$pattern] : 0;
    }

    Add the new line into the grid
    $lines[] = $line;
}

// Now, let's output it
foreach ($lines as $line)
{
    foreach ($line as $piece)
    {
        echo $piece;
    }
    echo "\n";
}
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/img/rule30output.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Tada!</p>

<h4>Merry Christmas!</h4>

<p>For mine, I changed 1 to <code>'/'</code> and 0 to <code>'*'</code>. Why? Because it's December, and it looks festive, that's why. I just taught you how to output a Christmas tree in your terminal!</p>

<p>Clearly, with the added nerdery, this is no longer a Christmas Tree. This is what we call a FSM Tree. The perfect DIY gift for your budget conscious nerd.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.giphy.com/media/14cUTtBgAXn7J6/giphy.gif" alt="image" /></p>

<p>And there you have it. Merry Christmas, Nerds.</p>

<h4>Post Script</h4>

<p>You may be wondering why the post title references Turing completeness<sup>(4)</sup>. As I mentioned before, our beloved Rule 30 has 254 siblings. One of these siblings is known as Rule 110, and this rule is turing complete.</p>

<p>The process for running through Rule 110 is the same as Rule 30 (that holds true for all 255 rules, by the by), the only change is the rules. So, if you're interested, here are the rules for Rule 110 (in Christmas tree format, of course)</p>

<pre><code>$rules = array(
    '///'=&gt; '*',
    '//*' =&gt; '/',
    '/*/'=&gt; '/',
    '/**' =&gt;'*',
    '*//'=&gt; '/',
    '*/*' =&gt; '/',
    '**/'=&gt; '/',
    '***' =&gt; '*'
);
</code></pre>

<p>Go forth and make a Turing machine.</p>

                        <h3>Ending the stigma.</h3>

<p>When you open up a story on Medium (for those of you who’ve never used it), the ghost prompt says “Tell your story..”</p>

<p>I’ve been staring at those words for five minutes now, not really reading them. It wasn’t until they finally registered that I knew what I needed to say here.</p>

<p>I want to talk about depression, but it’s difficult. It’s crazy difficult. And to talk about it in a personal sense? A sense that relates to my personal experiences? That’s almost impossible.</p>

<p>But it needs to not be impossible. It needs to be okay.</p>

<p>I was 13 when I tried to kill myself for the first time. I’ll never forget that day. I took a bottle of aspirin over the kitchen sink. I don’t remember wanting to die, or knowing that I was killing myself. I’d stayed home from school sick that day. I wasn’t really sick, I just didn’t feel like being around anyone outside of my own skin. I had a headache, and I went to the kitchen. I remember the aspirin (it was the generic uncoated kind) turning into mush in my mouth. I couldn’t swallow it all, and it tasted to vile. I coughed up a bunch and got a glass of water to swallow the rest down.</p>

<p>The next few hours of my life were a horrible, wretched, world spinning ride of nausea and pain. My parents came home, and they knew immediately something was wrong. My dad got me to throw up, and then the pain stopped. I remember throwing up pieces of my stomach lining, and my dad crying. I think he cried, anyway. I cried.</p>

<p>A year and a half later, I was diagnosed with depression and bipolar disorder, after being sexually abused.</p>

<p>I started smoking, and I started cutting. I have 13 scars up my right arm, including very crummily etched letters that spell “Fuck”. There are a few scars on my shoulder, too, and one on the inside of my wrist. I remember taking just enough aspirin to make the world spin and wash, but not enough to die. I wanted to die, and I hated myself for being too much of a coward to do it.</p>

<p>With my diagnosis came a prescription for Zoloft. But, when I looked at those little orange bottles, I didn’t see a way to get healthy, or any help for me. I saw a label, plastered across my face, that said I was sick. There was something WRONG with me, and I had to be fixed.</p>

<p>I didn’t take those pills. I stockpiled them, and eventually, I swallowed two bottles at once. I got my stomach pumped that day.</p>

<p>Eventually, I decided I wasn’t sick. Fuck being sick. Fuck being broken. I’m not that. I resolved to never take one of those pills ever again. I left highschool and went to college. I got pregnant, I had a daughter. I got married, and then divorced. I moved to the big city, I got married again, I had two boys, I finished school, I became a successful developer. I love my job, and I love my family, and most days, I love my life.</p>

<p>But here’s the truth: I can’t count the number of times I’ve wanted to die. I can’t count the number of times that I’ve sat alone and cried, because I couldn’t think of a single happy thing. Sometimes, I can’t think of anything at all, just an expansive nothingness. It eats at you, and if you let it, it will consume you.</p>

<p>I’m afraid to let everyone know. What if they don’t think I’m okay to do my job, once they know? What if my “successfull” career falls to shambles, because they think there’s something wrong with me? What if they take my kids because I’m sick? What if they judge me?</p>

<p>I’ve tried to tell people a few people close to me, but they shake their heads. They don’t believe me. When I was a kid, it was easy to see how messed up I was. I was slicing my arm to pieces, for Christ’s sake. But now; now I”m successful. Now, I’m a good mother and a good wife, and I have a successful career. There’s no way that I’m sick. They don’t believe it.</p>

<p>Today, reality came crashing in. Someone many people knew and loved died because of this disease, and hundreds of thousands of others have died before him. So here I am: I’m sick, and I hurt, and my hurt is no less real than if I were bleeding.</p>

<p>It’s odd to me, that I feel GUILTY for being sick. You don’t feel guilty for getting the flu, or pnuemonia, or cancer. Those are things that happen TO you, but for some reason, we’ve all decided that depression and mental illness are somehow our fault. Like I could have done something to stop it, or solve it.</p>

<p>I couldn’t. I can’t. I am me. I am beautiful, and funny and brilliant and successful. I am a good mother, and a good wife, and I have depression.</p>

<p>I don’t want your pity. I’d like support, and more than anything, I’d like awareness. I’d like to live in a world, where I can say, “Hey, I’m bipolar” without people looking at me like I’m a leper. I’d like to know that generations that come after us won’t be judged, or scared, or guilty, for having this sickness. One where they can seek help as easily and freely as people do when they have readily visible illnesses.</p>

<p>I have tweeted, and I will be tweeting once a day: my diagnosis, along with #endthestigma. If you’re willing to share yours, do. A simple tweet diagnosis and the hashtag. If you’re not, then feel free to retweet mine. More people need to know that it’s okay. That it will be okay.</p>

<p>And if anyone feels the way I have felt in the past, reach out. I will listen, always. I don’t care if I know you, or I don’t. I don’t care what time it is, or where I am. I have my cell phone on always, if you need someone to talk to, message me. Just say “Kayla, I need help.” You’ll have my full attention, I promise.</p>
