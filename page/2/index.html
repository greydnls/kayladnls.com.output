                <div class="post-content">
                    <div class="text-editor">
                        <p>TIL: Mathematicians may be outdoorsy people. They have words like trees, excursion, bridge, walk, path, meander. We're going to use all of these words rather frequently in this post. If you read it fast enough, it might even feel like we're talking about hiking.</p>

<p>Most of what I learned in research for this post came from Donald Knuth's 20th Anniversary Christmas Tree lecture [1]. Go, watch it, enjoy it, let it blow your mind. It's 76 minutes long and I was able to savor it for pretty much an entire day, and I can't promise that I won't be going back for seconds at some later date.</p>

<h4>Trees</h4>

<p>Today our main focus is going to be trees. As computer scientists, trees are highly important, and there are many different varieties. Trees with one node are called unary trees, two nodes are binary trees. three nodes are ternary, so forth and so on. Really, a tree can be made from any number. You can have pi-ary trees, 3/2-ary (said three-halfs-ary) trees, etc.</p>

<p>Today we wil focus primarily on ternary trees. For every node on a ternary tree, it will either be empty, or have three more ternary trees below it.  That looks something like this:</p>

<p><img src="/img/t-tree.jpg" alt="image" /><br />
Each circle represents a node, each square is empty.</p>

<p>To process a tree, we walk it, and generally we do that using a stack. For a ternary tree, when you encounter a square, you add one, when you encounter a circle, you subtract two. Every ternary tree will start out with an empty stack, and will end with an empty stack. This kind of walk is alled an <strong>excursion</strong>.</p>

<p>Let me take a minute to define the four main different kinds of walks:<br />
<img src="/img/walks.png" alt="image" /><br />
This image is a screen shot taken from Knuth's video. It's taken from a paper written by Cyril Banderier and Phillepe Flajolet [2] .</p>

<p>You can read the above as this:<br />
<strong>walk(<em>W</em>)</strong> : a walk that can fall above or below the x axis, and ends anywhere it pleases.<br />
<strong>bridge (<em>B</em>)</strong>:  just like a walk, but it MUST end at 0.<br />
<strong>meander (<em>M</em>)</strong>:  similar to a walk, except that MUST stay above the x axis. It can end where it pleases, though.<br />
<strong>excursion (<em>E</em>)</strong>: like a meander, in that it must be above the x axis, but like a bridge in that it must also end at 0.</p>

<p>So, when I say that a good ternary tree is an <strong>excursion</strong> what I mean is that it <strong>MUST</strong> stay above the x axis (y is always >= 0), and that it <strong>MUST</strong> end at (y == 0).</p>

<h4>Walks over Mountains</h4>

<p>A good visual of this is:<br />
<img src="/img/mountains.png" alt="image" /><br />
Also taken from Knuth's video</p>

<p>Remember from the previous drawing that our squares are +1 and our circles are -2. He's numbered the squares and lettered the circles for the above drawing. With that in mind, you can see that each time you encounter a number (square), you add one to the stack, and y increases by 1. Each time you encounter a letter (circle), you subtract 2, and y decrease by 2.</p>

<p>So how many possible ways are there are walking a ternary tree?</p>

<p>As we go through this, picture a graph in your mind, much like the mountains pictured above.</p>

<p>Exponents represent points on that graph, where <strong>z's</strong> exponent is the x coordinant and <strong>u's</strong> exponent is the y axis. <strong>z<sup>3</sup>u<sup>4</sup></strong> represents a pt (3,4) on that graph.</p>

<p>Coefficients will represent the different number of ways we could have gotten to that point at that step of the walk. <strong>3u</strong> means there were 3 different ways to get to u.</p>

<p>To help with this visualization, I will write both the exponential form of the step, but also the point that it would represent on the graph.</p>

<p>We start at the origin 0 == 1 (0, 0)<br />
1. <strong>First step</strong> our only option is to go right one, and up one. --> z<sup>1</sup>u<sup>1</sup> --> (1, 1)<br />
2. <strong>Second step</strong>, our only option is right one, up one    --> z<sup>2</sup>u<sup>2</sup> --> (2, 2)<br />
3. <strong>Third step</strong>, we can either go up one, or down two            --> z<sup>3</sup>(1 + u<sup>3</sup>) --> possible points here are (3, 0), (3, 3)<br />
4. <strong>Fourth step</strong>, remember from the previous line that we're currently either sitting at 0, or 3. So, we can go up one to u<sup>1</sup>, or down two to u<sup>1</sup>, or up one to u<sup>4</sup>)  --> z<sup>4</sup>(2u + u<sup>4</sup>), three options: (4, 1), (4,1), (4, 4);<br />
5. <strong>Fifth step</strong>,  there are three ways to get to u<sup>2</sup> and one way to get to u<sup>5</sup> --> z<sup>5</sup>(3u<sup>2</sup>+u<sup>5</sup>) (5, 2), (5, 2), (5, 2) (5, 5)<br />
6. <strong>Sixth step</strong> There are 3 ways to get to zero, 5 ways to get to u<sup>3</sup> and one way to get to u<sup>6</sup> --> z<sup>6></sup>(3 + 4u<sup>4</sup> + u<sup>6</sup>) (6, 0), (6, 0), (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 3), (6, 3), (6, 3), (6, 6)</p>

<p>So far, we are 6 steps into our walk, and we have following equation.</p>

<p><strong>z<sup>1</sup>u<sup>1</sup> + z<sup>2</sup>u<sup>2</sup> + z<sup>3</sup>(1 + u<sup>3</sup>) + z<sup>4</sup>(2u + u<sup>4</sup>) + z<sup>5</sup>(3u<sup>2</sup>+u<sup>5</sup>) + z<sup>6</sup>(3 + 4u<sup>4</sup> + u<sup>6</sup>)</strong></p>

<p>At this point, if you remove the z's and u's and focus solely on the coefficients and exponents of u, you are able to place them into a table. Treating each row as an "iteration" and each column as a point u<sup>x</sup>, you can see the various different ending points that would be available on any artbitrary z-length <strong>meander</strong> along a ternary tree.</p>

<p>Each number on the following graph represents the number of possibilities your meander would have to end at that point, given that length (z).</p>

<p>What patterns can we see here? As you move onto the next row, you look at the row above you.</p>

<p>We know that we are constrained to steps of either +1, -2. In this case, adding moves you to the left, subtracting moves you to the right.  So, to determine each cell in a new row, look at the cell directly above it. Go one cell back, then go two cells forward, add those two numbers, and that's the number that goes in the cell in question.</p>

<p>Look at row 8. How did we get 12? Up one, left one (+1), up one, right 2 (-2) gives up 7 and 5, those combine to equal 12.</p>

<p>If you're looking for a function to generate such a table, have no fear! I have you covered:</p>

<pre><code>$rows = array();

$line1 = array(1);
$rows[] = $line1;

$iterations = 25;

for ($row = 1; $row&lt; $iterations; $row++)
{
    $line = array();
    for($column = 0; $column &lt;= $row; $column++)
    {
         $first_number  = isset($rows[$row - 1 ][$column - 1 ]) ? $rows[$row - 1 ][$column - 1 ] : 0;
         $second_number = isset($rows[$row - 1 ][$column + 2 ]) ? $rows[$row - 1 ][$column + 2 ] : 0;

        $line[] = $first_number + $second_number;
    }
    $rows[] = $line;
}

foreach ($rows as $row)
{
    foreach ($row as $cell)
    {
        echo $cell."\t";
    }
    echo "\n";
}        

</code></pre>

<p>Okay, so this is all good and fine. You can draw a tree with circles and squares, and you can walk that tree to make a nice mountain picture. You can even manually calculate each possibilities, to a certain extent. Lovely. But what if I asked you to tell me how many different mountain pictures you could draw, with a tree of X nodes? How would you be able to tell me?</p>

<p>Or, perhaps I ask you to tell me what position of y you might be at, after you've "walked" 4 steps?</p>

<p>Sure, you could draw all of those mountains and walk all of those trees, but that sounds awfully tiring. It would be much better if you knew a formula to do that. Even better still if you could translate that formula into some code and make your computer do all the legwork, right?</p>

<p>Great, let's do that.</p>

<h4>These computes were made for walkin...</h4>

<p>There are some fairly famous numbers called Catalan numbers that are used to find the number of binary trees with N nodes. These numbers were defined by Eugene Charles Catalan[3] (he's a cool cat, you should look him up).</p>

<p>Catalan numbers are defined as follows:<br />
<img src="/img/catalan.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>For anyone who needs a refresher (I was completely lost here for a bit, so let me save you the trouble), the (2n n) is a binomial coefficient, which is calculated as follows:<br />
<img src="/img/bico.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>with n! denoting a factorial.</p>

<p>When you run that function for a given N, you're able to find out the number of binary trees with N many nodes. The sequence of those values are known as the Catalan numbers:  1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132.. etc etc etc.</p>

<p>Wait,... why am I talking about Catalan numbers? Those only apply to binary trees, and we're interested in ternary trees, right?  Well, you can generalize that catalan function to work for other trees as well!</p>

<p>That generalized function looks like this:<br />
<img src="/img/fuss-catalan.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Where x denotes the type of tree (1 for unary, 3 for ternary, etc) and n denotes the number of nodes we're asking about. If I want to know how many ternary trees with 4 internal nodes, I would do x = 3 (for ternary) and n = 4.  As promised, let's have our computer take care of the heavy lifting:</p>

<pre><code>$n = 4;
function ternary($n)
{
    return pow(((2*$n) + 1), -1) * binomialCoefficient((3*$n), $n);
}

echo ternary($n);
</code></pre>

<p>The answer? 55.</p>

<p>So, that's neat, and you can feel free to play around with it, popping in different values for x and n. But what about the sequence? There is a sequence of Catalan numbers corresponding to each n internal nodes on a binary tree. Can we do the same thing for our ternary trees? But of course we can!</p>

<p>The function to generate the sequence for ternary trees looks like this:<br />
<img src="/img/tofz.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Where t is the number denoting the type of tree (just like x did above), k is the number of "steps" you want to take (just like n above) and r is the number of trees you want to consider (yes, you can do more than one tree at a time).</p>

<pre><code>$t = 3;
$r = 1;
$k = 4;

$arr = array_fill(0, $k, 0);

$string_answer = "1 +";
foreach ($arr as $idx =&gt; $value)
{
    $i = $idx + 1;
    $n1 = ($t*$i) + $r;
    $n2 = $i;

    $bc = binomialCoefficient($n1, $n2);
    $answer = $bc * ($r/(($t*$i) +$r));

    $string_answer .= strval($answer)."z^".$i." + ";
}
</code></pre>

<p>What comes out?   <strong>1 + 1z<sup>1</sup> + 3z<sup>2</sup> + 12z<sup>3</sup> + 55z<sup>4</sup></strong><br />
You can see from this that the sequence of the first 4 numbers for ternary trees is: 1, 1, 3, 12, 55,</p>

<p>One last thing, the icing on the cake, if you will. Take a look back up at the table that we built earlier. You can see we only got 8 steps in manually, but if you run the code provided I took it out to 25 steps. Remove all of the zeroes, and then look at the left most column.</p>

<p>What do you see? 1, 1, 3, 12, 55. That looks familiar, doesn't it? That's because that column corresponds to the times when your walk ends at u<sup>0</sup> or y == 0. Recall that terniary trees are all <strong>excursions</strong> and must begin their walk at 0, and all of them must complete their walk at 0, and this makes perfect sense.</p>

<p>For a little extra<br />
<img src="http://i3.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/009/993/tumblr_m0wb2xz9Yh1r08e3p.jpg" alt="image" /><br />
The row second from the left corresponds to the sequence of numbers for <strong>B<sub>3</sub>(z)<sup>2</sup></strong> that is, squared ternary trees. The third row from the left corresponds to the cubed function, so on and so forth. You can use the code above to prove that, switching out the different numbers for r.</p>

  1. Yes, I know my hand writing is attrocious.<br />
  2. Galaxy note pen is awesome for this stuff.<br />
  3. It took me about 10 hours to watch that 76 minute video and glean this knowledge, so if it doesn't 'click' don't worry .<br />
  4. There's a lot in the video I didn't cover here. Specifically anything having to do with 3/2-trees as well as Duchon numbers, but I do have notes on all of it, if you're interested.<br />

                <div class="post-content">
                    <div class="text-editor">
                        <p>Welcome to the first post in a new Machine Learning Series I'll be writing. We'll start from the top, covering what machine learning is at the most basic level. Each post will cover another topic, giving a more in depth view of key concepts and ideas.</p>

<h4>Machine Learning: What even is it?</h4>

<p>Machine learning. What do you think of when you hear that? If you're like most people (or at least like me) you think of SkyNet. Sentient computers that take over the world and enslave all of mankind.</p>

<p>Really, though, what Machine learning really is: MATH. Math, and magic and a whole lot of power. If you're already having horribly flashbacks to Calculus class, don't run away screaming just yet. Focus more on the "magic" and "power" parts. The math will come, I promise.</p>

<p>If you spend any time on the internet at all, you probably come into contact with dozens of services a day that use some form of machine learning. Do you use Gmail or a similar service that automatically detects "spam" for you and filters it out of your inbox? Are you on twitter right now, staring at a list of "Suggested" accounts for you to follow?</p>

<p>Both of those are examples of Machine Learning in action.</p>

<p>**Textbook Definition: **</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Machine learning is a scientific discipline that explores the construction and study of algorithms that can learn from data.[1]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Machine learning is about understanding data, and drawing conclusions from that data. There is a vast array of tools (algorithms) available to us to help us do that. The magic of these algorithms? They do all the work.</p>

<p>These algorithms are given a <strong>training dataset</strong> to learn from. Their accuracy is then run against a <strong>test dataset</strong> to confirm that they are performing well. Once that is done, you can feel relatively safe running the algorithm against real world data.</p>

<p>Think of both the training and test datasets as "past experiences". You're giving your algorithm a set of past experiences and telling it to learn from it. You can then hand it a "new experience", and based on what it has learned, it will predict the outcome for you.</p>

<h4>What can you do with it?</h4>

<p>There are two main types of Machine Learning (also called Statistical Learning): <strong>Supervised</strong> and <strong>Unsupervised</strong>.  I'll explain both breifly, and we'll go into more depth in future posts in this series.</p>

<h5>Supervised</h5>

<p>Supervised statistical learning methods build a statistical model for predicting or estimating output based on input(s). Within the field of supervised learning, there are two more clasifications: Those algorithms that give continuous,  quantitative output and those that give non-numeric or categorical (qualitative) output.</p>

<p>A common form of quantitative supervised learning is called <strong>Regression</strong>. 
**Example: **We have a dataset of <code>WageData</code> that includes information about the age, education, wage and calendar year of men in a specific area of the country. We can use a regression algorithm to create a model such that, given another man's information, we can accurately predict his wages.</p>

<p>A common form of qualitative supervised is <strong>Classification</strong>.<br />
<strong>Example:</strong> By examining stock market data containing daily movements in the S&amp;P 500 over a 5 year period, we are able to predict whether tomorrow's index will <em>increase</em> or <em>decrease</em>.  (PS: This is very hard to do, so don't get your hopes up that this series will teach you to become a Wall Street bajillionaire.)</p>

<h5>Unsupervised</h5>

<p>Unsupervised methods have input, but no output. Instead, we're trying to learn about the structure of the data, and relationships within that data. In this case, we're not trying to predict or estimate, but observe.</p>

<p>A common type of Unsupervised learning is called <strong>Clustering</strong>. 
<strong>Example</strong> Given market demographics for customers of our company (age, Annual house hold income, etc) we can analyze the data and find "groupings" or "clusters" within the data. Further analysis of those clusters can help us understand how each group is related to the other.</p>

<p>So, there you have it. A quick, preliminary rundown of what Machine Learning is. More to come!</p>

                        <h4>"Have you ever heard of Rule 30?"</h4>

<p>A friend chirped me in skype asking if I was familiar with "Rule 30". He's going in for a job interview and they'd asked him to code this Rule 30 as an exercise. I hadn't heard of it, but I was intruiged, and I'm always one to try to help a friend. Off to the Google-Mobile, Batman!</p>

<p>As I would learn, <code>Rule 30</code> refers to something introduced by  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Wolfram">Stephen Wolfram</a> in 1983]<sup> (1)</sup>.  Even if you're not familiar with Wolfram, you're probably familiar with his work. Especially, if you took any <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/">college level Calculus classes</a>. He was a computer scientist, and word is he was pretty good at the maths. If you don't know him, check him out, cool dude.</p>

<p>Anyway, on to this Rule 30 business. Rule 30 is one of many rules that pertains to binary cellular automaton<sup> (2)</sup>. Now, when I read that the first time, they lost me halfway through binary. If you're like me, never fear!</p>

<h4>Elementary Celluar Automaton</h4>

<p>So, how's this work? For each cell there are two possible values: 1 or 0. Each of Wolfram's "Rules" (there are 255 of them) defines a list of rules that tell you how to determine whether a given cell is 1 or 0. It does this by analyzing the "neghborhood" of the cell in question. What is meant by neighborhood is discussed in more detail below.</p>

<h4>What it means to be 1D</h4>

<p>You may be famliar with other Cellular Automata, such as Conway's game of life Game of Life<sup>(3)</sup>. This method is similar, but there is a primary difference. Game of Life is 2-dimensional, with a third dimension of time. That means that as the rules are applied and the pattern progresses, the "board" is refreshed.</p>

<p>Rule 30 and it's siblings are 1-Dimensional. In this case, the y axis is, in fact, time. That means that as the program is run the new output is appended to the old, rather than the entire "board" refreshing.</p>

<h4>Why "Rule 30"?</h4>

<p>Since there are<code>2×2×2 = 8</code> possible binary states for the three cells neighboring a given cell, there are a total of <code>2^8=256</code> elementary cellular automata, each of which can be indexed with an 8-bit binary number.</p>

<p>So, Binary: 00011110 = decimal 30. Therefore, Rule 30. This holds true for all of the other rules, too, by the way. Not terribly important, but I found it interesting, so there you have it. Moving on.</p>

<h4>Ruleception</h4>

<p>Yes! Rules inside rules!</p>

<p><img src="/img/rule30.gif" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Above are the rules given for Rule 30. This is how you determine whether your "cell" is a 1 or a 0. Upon first inspection, this made absolutely 0 sense to me. (binary pun possibly intended?).</p>

<p>What you need to understand here is what is meant by "neighborhood". When you're determining the 1/0ness of a cell, you look at it's neighborhood and compare that against the rules. Neighborhood being the three cells above it. So, 111 = 0, 110 = 0, so forth and so on. Once you get your mind around that, you're off to the races.</p>

<p>Once you have your rules, you apply them to the given input (in this case a single "line" of the grid with at least one cell set to "1"). What do you get?</p>

<p><img src="/img/rule30graph.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>So Pretty.</p>

<p>But how do you DO it? Well, let me show you.</p>

<h4>The Codez.</h4>

<p>*** Warning!** I have absolutely no intention of using OO practices here. No classes will be made, no injection will be used. I will interface nothing. If this makes you uncomfortable, you may want to stop reading.*</p>

<p>End result, I want to create this cool looking graph thing. That's how a picture it, a graph, or grid, Once you're there, it becomes a matter of some setup, and then some iteration. It looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>//First thing's first, let's codify those rules. 
$rules = array(
    '111'=&gt; 0,
    '110' =&gt; 0,
    '101'=&gt; 0,
    '100' =&gt; 1,
    '011'=&gt; 1,
    '010' =&gt; 1,
    '001'=&gt; 1,
    '000' =&gt; 0
);

//create an empty array to hold your grid
$lines = array();

//set up that first line 
$first_line = array_fill(0, 51, 0);

// make sure you set at least one of those cells to 1,
// or this will going no where fase. 
$first_line[24] = 1;

//now add your line to the grid. 
$lines[] = $first_line;

//Lets compile that grid

// I'm doing 10 iterations, you can do as many as you like. 
for ($i = 0; $i&lt; 10; $i++)
{
    // make a new line
    $line = array();

    for($j = 0; $j&lt; 51; $j++)
    {
        // The "pattern" is determined by the "neighborhood" or the 3 cells in the 
        // generation (row) above our cell in question. 
        $pattern = (string)implode('', array_slice(end($lines), $j - 1, 3));

         // if we have a valid value, great. Elsewise, give is a 0. 
         $line[] = (strlen($pattern) == 3 &amp;&amp; isset($rules[$pattern])) ? $rules[$pattern] : 0;
    }

    Add the new line into the grid
    $lines[] = $line;
}

// Now, let's output it
foreach ($lines as $line)
{
    foreach ($line as $piece)
    {
        echo $piece;
    }
    echo "\n";
}
</code></pre>

<p>Tada!</p>

<h4>Merry Christmas!</h4>

<p>For mine, I changed 1 to <code>'/'</code> and 0 to <code>'*'</code>. Why? Because it's December, and it looks festive, that's why. I just taught you how to output a Christmas tree in your terminal!</p>

<p>Clearly, with the added nerdery, this is no longer a Christmas Tree. This is what we call a FSM Tree. The perfect DIY gift for your budget conscious nerd.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.giphy.com/media/14cUTtBgAXn7J6/giphy.gif" alt="image" /></p>

<p>And there you have it. Merry Christmas, Nerds.</p>

<h4>Post Script</h4>

<p>You may be wondering why the post title references Turing completeness<sup>(4)</sup>. As I mentioned before, our beloved Rule 30 has 254 siblings. One of these siblings is known as Rule 110, and this rule is turing complete.</p>

<p>The process for running through Rule 110 is the same as Rule 30 (that holds true for all 255 rules, by the by), the only change is the rules. So, if you're interested, here are the rules for Rule 110 (in Christmas tree format, of course)</p>

<pre><code>$rules = array(
    '///'=&gt; '*',
    '//*' =&gt; '/',
    '/*/'=&gt; '/',
    '/**' =&gt;'*',
    '*//'=&gt; '/',
    '*/*' =&gt; '/',
    '**/'=&gt; '/',
    '***' =&gt; '*'
);
</code></pre>

<p>Go forth and make a Turing machine.</p>
