                <div class="post-content">
                    <div class="text-editor">
                        <p>A few weeks ago I wrote a blog post venting my frustrations with the current state of the tech industry, specifically related to how women are treated in the field. It wasn’t terribly rational. I was complaining, and I had no solutions to offer on the matter.</p>

<p>I’ve had a lot of good conversations about the issue since. I’ve spoken with people who agree, who kind of agree, and a few who completely disagree. It’s forced me to sit down and analyze my thoughts. To really solidify what I saw as the problem, and possible ways of approaching it. In short, I’ve learned a lot.</p>

<p>First: I would like to address the things I said about women’s outreach programs. I originally found such groups/classes/etc patronizing and exclusionary. Turns out, they are neither. From what I’ve learned, these groups aren’t “PHP for women and women only” more like “PHP for people who aren’t misogynistic jerks”. There might be a bit of a messaging disconnect there. They’re aiming to create a safe, welcoming place for women to exist in our industry. I think that’s great.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>This isn’t a women’s issue. It’s an everyone issue.</h3>
</blockquote>

<p>Second: This isn’t a women’s issue. It’s a minorities issue. Really, it’s an everyone issue. I had the pleasure of speaking with an Italian developer who’s felt and seen treatment similar to what I’ve experienced, simply because English isn’t his native language.</p>

<p>Here’s where I ended up: The industry I work in now is not the industry that I want to work in. I love what I do for a living. I love a great many of the people I’ve met while doing that thing that I love to do. I don’t love being treated like an outsider. I don’t love feeling like I don’t, or can’t have a voice. I don’t love seeing other people treated like that.</p>

<p>I want to work in an industry that is welcoming and empowering. I want people outside our industry to look in and see a place where people, all people, regardless of their demographics, are able to do great things. A place that is supportive and helpful. The more people we have doing what we do, the more brains we have in the room, solving the problems that we’re solving, the better off we’re all going to be.</p>

<p>For all we know, there’s a girl who’s written the code to solve the same problem you’ve been beating your head against your keyboard over for months. Except, it’s sitting on her hard drive somewhere, because she’s too scared of being judged, or she doesn’t feel confident enough to share it. Empower that girl. In short, empower all the people.</p>

<p>There’s no overnight fix for this. There is no switch we can flip and correct it, no algorithm that can be written to magically make everyone get along. We do have the power to fix it, though. Each of us, incrementally, iteratively. People have power. A giant organism can be changed, simply by transforming each of the tiny molecules that make up that organism. Similarly, our community as a whole can be changed, if each of us vows to change it. It will take time, but it’s something well worth undertaking.</p>

<p>To this end, I came up with the Code Manifesto. It is simply a list of values. If each of us committed ourselves to upholding these values, the space in which we work would be a better place to be. The list is in no way comprehensive. It is very much a work in progress, and I’d love to see input from the community. It’s on github, and pull requests are welcome. Add to it, modify it, make it something that each of us can stand for and be proud to represent.</p>

<p>I had the amazing opportunity to give a lightening talk at Laracon in NYC last week. I chose to talk about the Manifesto, what it is, and what brought it on.</p>

<p>This was my first conference, and my first time talking in front of that many people. It was, hands down, one of the scariest things I’ve ever done, and also one of the most gratifying. I stood on a brightly lit stage, in front of roughly 280 of my peers and explained how and why I felt things are broken. And also what I think we can do to fix them.</p>

<p>I spoke for about fifteen minutes. My voice broke a few times. My palms were sweating, and I was really worried that the things I was saying were silly. But I stood up there, and I said what I came to say.</p>

<p>And then they clapped, and all the fear melted away. Stepping off that stage I felt high. Maybe higher than I’ve ever felt. Sliding back into my chair afterwards and seeing the response on twitter brought a tear to my eye. A few of them, to be honest.</p>

<p>For the next day and a half people came up to me as I walked around the conference to thank me, to tell me that they agree. They wanted to talk about the issues we’re all facing, and discuss what we can do to fix them. Men and women alike were talking about it. They were on board. It was, and still is, surreal. But it gives me hope. Hope that people not only see the problem, but that they want to fix it.</p>

                    <div class="text-editor">
                        <h2>The life and times of a girl developer</h2>

<p>I’m a web developer, application architect, builder of things or just general nerd. I also happen to be the proud owner of a vagina (or as I recently learned, a growler. I guess it’s a British thing).</p>

<p>Somehow, being the former and having the latter means I am some kind of oddity. I’ve been met with skepticism, mistrust, and probably the most insulting reaction; complete shock and awe.</p>

<p>It’s bothered me forever, and I think I can finally put it into words.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>I am not a bloody unicorn.</h2>
</blockquote>

<p>Please, stop offering me grants, scholarships, job offers, special courses, conferences, books, blog posts, or any other kind of annoying, passive condescension based solely on the fact that I am a girl. Never, for any reason append any professional compliment with “..for a girl” (yes, this has happened). Don’t tell me I’m the “best female” anything.</p>

<p>If I’m offered something, I want it to be because of my accomplishments, and not my sex. I can guarantee you my lack of a Y chromosome has exactly nothing to do with my ability or lack there of. If I suck, tell me. I can take it, I promise.</p>

<p>Bottom line: Girls aren’t any different. We’re different because people keep making us different. Most of these people are well intentioned; they’re trying to help, and I do appreciate the thought. But it’s not helping.</p>

<p>Treating women as if we need extra help, or an extra push or an extra anything doesn’t broadcast to the community as a whole that we are just as capable as our male counterparts. No, it says that we need just a little bit more something to get to the places and do the things that men are able to do on their own.</p>

<p>I have an AS in computer science. I studied C++ and some Java in school, and today I’m a PHP developer. All the PHP I know I taught myself via books, online resources, reading the documentation, etc. So, I feel that I’ve gotten a pretty good overview of the kinds of resources that are available to novice developers trying to scrape together some semblance of a skill set.</p>

<p>Never in all that roaming of the world wide interwebs have I seen a course titled “HTML5 for men” or a summer retreat workshop called “BoyCode”. I’ve never seen GingerCode, either, for that matter. In fact, the only demographic specification I’ve seen in resources is directed at women. It doesn’t make sense to me.</p>

<p>I’ve nearly written this a number a times, and stopped myself. The whole thing sounds a little #firstworldproblems. Essentially, I’m complaining about people creating too many resources targeted at me, which might be a foolish things to bitch about.</p>

<p>I think it’s more than that, though. I recently listened to Jeffrey Way on the LaravelIO Podcast talking about Imposter Syndrome. The whole time he was describing it, I was emphatically nodding along. That’s how I feel. All. The. Time. After that episode, I had to look it up.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Impostor syndrome is a psychological phenomenon in which people are unable to internalize their accomplishments. Despite external evidence they remain convinced that they are frauds and do not deserve the success they have achieved. Proof of success is dismissed as luck, timing, or as a result of deceiving others into thinking they are more intelligent and competent than they believe themselves to be.
  I’ve heard a lot of developers say they feel this way. Developers that I look up to, who I know are good at what they do. This is in no way something is isolated to women, but I think the kinds of targeted resources that are pointed at girls could contribute to or intensify it for girls. For me personally, I think it’s a factor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This whole rant seems a bit hypocritical considering I recently toyed with the idea of creating a web site focused on Laravel outreach for women. I’ve gotten really into Laravel lately, and it’s a bit early, but I think I’m in love. I want to shout about the greatness of this tool from the tops of mountains and talk about it with anyone or anything that has ears (and I frequently do).</p>

<p>I noticed that I wasn’t seeing any other girls in the community. I’m tired of sitting in rooms full of men and feeling out of place. I know other women are out there, I know they’re building awesome stuff. But prevailingly, the loudest voices are male ones.</p>

<p>I did a little outreach to other female laravel devs to get their opinion, and they responded with words that just as likely could have fallen from my lips if someone other than myself had asked me what I thought of the idea. There were a few positives, but most of them were something along the lines of “Seriously? Really? Why?”</p>

<p>Immediately I felt the wonderful kind of self loathing that can only happen when you realize that you’ve become something that you hate. I was trying to build the same kind of platform I groan and roll my eyes at. There has to be a better answer.</p>

<p>If there’s an answer to the problem, I haven’t found it yet, but I’m still looking. If you find it before I do, feel free to let me know.</p>

<h2>    - posts_categories</h2>

<p>Welcome to the first post in a new Machine Learning Series I'll be writing. We'll start from the top, covering what machine learning is at the most basic level. Each post will cover another topic, giving a more in depth view of key concepts and ideas.</p>

<h4>Machine Learning: What even is it?</h4>

<p>Machine learning. What do you think of when you hear that? If you're like most people (or at least like me) you think of SkyNet. Sentient computers that take over the world and enslave all of mankind.</p>

<p>Really, though, what Machine learning really is: MATH. Math, and magic and a whole lot of power. If you're already having horribly flashbacks to Calculus class, don't run away screaming just yet. Focus more on the "magic" and "power" parts. The math will come, I promise.</p>

<p>If you spend any time on the internet at all, you probably come into contact with dozens of services a day that use some form of machine learning. Do you use Gmail or a similar service that automatically detects "spam" for you and filters it out of your inbox? Are you on twitter right now, staring at a list of "Suggested" accounts for you to follow?</p>

<p>Both of those are examples of Machine Learning in action.</p>

<p>**Textbook Definition: **</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Machine learning is a scientific discipline that explores the construction and study of algorithms that can learn from data.[1]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Machine learning is about understanding data, and drawing conclusions from that data. There is a vast array of tools (algorithms) available to us to help us do that. The magic of these algorithms? They do all the work.</p>

<p>These algorithms are given a <strong>training dataset</strong> to learn from. Their accuracy is then run against a <strong>test dataset</strong> to confirm that they are performing well. Once that is done, you can feel relatively safe running the algorithm against real world data.</p>

<p>Think of both the training and test datasets as "past experiences". You're giving your algorithm a set of past experiences and telling it to learn from it. You can then hand it a "new experience", and based on what it has learned, it will predict the outcome for you.</p>

<h4>What can you do with it?</h4>

<p>There are two main types of Machine Learning (also called Statistical Learning): <strong>Supervised</strong> and <strong>Unsupervised</strong>.  I'll explain both breifly, and we'll go into more depth in future posts in this series.</p>

<h5>Supervised</h5>

<p>Supervised statistical learning methods build a statistical model for predicting or estimating output based on input(s). Within the field of supervised learning, there are two more clasifications: Those algorithms that give continuous,  quantitative output and those that give non-numeric or categorical (qualitative) output.</p>

<p>A common form of quantitative supervised learning is called <strong>Regression</strong>. 
**Example: **We have a dataset of <code>WageData</code> that includes information about the age, education, wage and calendar year of men in a specific area of the country. We can use a regression algorithm to create a model such that, given another man's information, we can accurately predict his wages.</p>

<p>A common form of qualitative supervised is <strong>Classification</strong>.<br />
<strong>Example:</strong> By examining stock market data containing daily movements in the S&amp;P 500 over a 5 year period, we are able to predict whether tomorrow's index will <em>increase</em> or <em>decrease</em>.  (PS: This is very hard to do, so don't get your hopes up that this series will teach you to become a Wall Street bajillionaire.)</p>

<h5>Unsupervised</h5>

<p>Unsupervised methods have input, but no output. Instead, we're trying to learn about the structure of the data, and relationships within that data. In this case, we're not trying to predict or estimate, but observe.</p>

<p>A common type of Unsupervised learning is called <strong>Clustering</strong>. 
<strong>Example</strong> Given market demographics for customers of our company (age, Annual house hold income, etc) we can analyze the data and find "groupings" or "clusters" within the data. Further analysis of those clusters can help us understand how each group is related to the other.</p>

<p>So, there you have it. A quick, preliminary rundown of what Machine Learning is. More to come!</p>
