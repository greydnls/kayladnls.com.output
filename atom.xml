            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>TIL: Mathematicians may be outdoorsy people. They have words like trees, excursion, bridge, walk, path, meander. We're going to use all of these words rather frequently in this post. If you read it fast enough, it might even feel like we're talking about hiking.</p>

<p>Most of what I learned in research for this post came from Donald Knuth's 20th Anniversary Christmas Tree lecture [1]. Go, watch it, enjoy it, let it blow your mind. It's 76 minutes long and I was able to savor it for pretty much an entire day, and I can't promise that I won't be going back for seconds at some later date.</p>

<h4>Trees</h4>

<p>Today our main focus is going to be trees. As computer scientists, trees are highly important, and there are many different varieties. Trees with one node are called unary trees, two nodes are binary trees. three nodes are ternary, so forth and so on. Really, a tree can be made from any number. You can have pi-ary trees, 3/2-ary (said three-halfs-ary) trees, etc.</p>

<p>Today we wil focus primarily on ternary trees. For every node on a ternary tree, it will either be empty, or have three more ternary trees below it.  That looks something like this:</p>

<p><img src="/img/t-tree.jpg" alt="image" /><br />
Each circle represents a node, each square is empty.</p>

<p>To process a tree, we walk it, and generally we do that using a stack. For a ternary tree, when you encounter a square, you add one, when you encounter a circle, you subtract two. Every ternary tree will start out with an empty stack, and will end with an empty stack. This kind of walk is alled an <strong>excursion</strong>.</p>

<p>Let me take a minute to define the four main different kinds of walks:<br />
<img src="/img/walks.png" alt="image" /><br />
This image is a screen shot taken from Knuth's video. It's taken from a paper written by Cyril Banderier and Phillepe Flajolet [2] .</p>

<p>You can read the above as this:<br />
<strong>walk(<em>W</em>)</strong> : a walk that can fall above or below the x axis, and ends anywhere it pleases.<br />
<strong>bridge (<em>B</em>)</strong>:  just like a walk, but it MUST end at 0.<br />
<strong>meander (<em>M</em>)</strong>:  similar to a walk, except that MUST stay above the x axis. It can end where it pleases, though.<br />
<strong>excursion (<em>E</em>)</strong>: like a meander, in that it must be above the x axis, but like a bridge in that it must also end at 0.</p>

<p>So, when I say that a good ternary tree is an <strong>excursion</strong> what I mean is that it <strong>MUST</strong> stay above the x axis (y is always >= 0), and that it <strong>MUST</strong> end at (y == 0).</p>

<h4>Walks over Mountains</h4>

<p>A good visual of this is:<br />
<img src="/img/mountains.png" alt="image" /><br />
Also taken from Knuth's video</p>

<p>Remember from the previous drawing that our squares are +1 and our circles are -2. He's numbered the squares and lettered the circles for the above drawing. With that in mind, you can see that each time you encounter a number (square), you add one to the stack, and y increases by 1. Each time you encounter a letter (circle), you subtract 2, and y decrease by 2.</p>

<p>So how many possible ways are there are walking a ternary tree?</p>

<p>As we go through this, picture a graph in your mind, much like the mountains pictured above.</p>

<p>Exponents represent points on that graph, where <strong>z's</strong> exponent is the x coordinant and <strong>u's</strong> exponent is the y axis. <strong>z<sup>3</sup>u<sup>4</sup></strong> represents a pt (3,4) on that graph.</p>

<p>Coefficients will represent the different number of ways we could have gotten to that point at that step of the walk. <strong>3u</strong> means there were 3 different ways to get to u.</p>

<p>To help with this visualization, I will write both the exponential form of the step, but also the point that it would represent on the graph.</p>

<p>We start at the origin 0 == 1 (0, 0)<br />
1. <strong>First step</strong> our only option is to go right one, and up one. --> z<sup>1</sup>u<sup>1</sup> --> (1, 1)<br />
2. <strong>Second step</strong>, our only option is right one, up one    --> z<sup>2</sup>u<sup>2</sup> --> (2, 2)<br />
3. <strong>Third step</strong>, we can either go up one, or down two            --> z<sup>3</sup>(1 + u<sup>3</sup>) --> possible points here are (3, 0), (3, 3)<br />
4. <strong>Fourth step</strong>, remember from the previous line that we're currently either sitting at 0, or 3. So, we can go up one to u<sup>1</sup>, or down two to u<sup>1</sup>, or up one to u<sup>4</sup>)  --> z<sup>4</sup>(2u + u<sup>4</sup>), three options: (4, 1), (4,1), (4, 4);<br />
5. <strong>Fifth step</strong>,  there are three ways to get to u<sup>2</sup> and one way to get to u<sup>5</sup> --> z<sup>5</sup>(3u<sup>2</sup>+u<sup>5</sup>) (5, 2), (5, 2), (5, 2) (5, 5)<br />
6. <strong>Sixth step</strong> There are 3 ways to get to zero, 5 ways to get to u<sup>3</sup> and one way to get to u<sup>6</sup> --> z<sup>6></sup>(3 + 4u<sup>4</sup> + u<sup>6</sup>) (6, 0), (6, 0), (6, 0), (6, 3), (6, 3), (6, 3), (6, 3), (6, 6)</p>

<p>So far, we are 6 steps into our walk, and we have following equation.</p>

<p><strong>z<sup>1</sup>u<sup>1</sup> + z<sup>2</sup>u<sup>2</sup> + z<sup>3</sup>(1 + u<sup>3</sup>) + z<sup>4</sup>(2u + u<sup>4</sup>) + z<sup>5</sup>(3u<sup>2</sup>+u<sup>5</sup>) + z<sup>6</sup>(3 + 4u<sup>4</sup> + u<sup>6</sup>)</strong></p>

<p>At this point, if you remove the z's and u's and focus solely on the coefficients and exponents of u, you are able to place them into a table. Treating each row as an "iteration" and each column as a point u<sup>x</sup>, you can see the various different ending points that would be available on any artbitrary z-length <strong>meander</strong> along a ternary tree.</p>

<p>Each number on the following graph represents the number of possibilities your meander would have to end at that point, given that length (z).</p>

<p>What patterns can we see here? As you move onto the next row, you look at the row above you.</p>

<p>We know that we are constrained to steps of either +1, -2. In this case, adding moves you to the left, subtracting moves you to the right.  So, to determine each cell in a new row, look at the cell directly above it. Go one cell back, then go two cells forward, add those two numbers, and that's the number that goes in the cell in question.</p>

<p>Look at row 8. How did we get 12? Up one, left one (+1), up one, right 2 (-2) gives up 7 and 5, those combine to equal 12.</p>

<p>If you're looking for a function to generate such a table, have no fear! I have you covered:</p>

<pre><code>$rows = array();

$line1 = array(1);
$rows[] = $line1;

$iterations = 25;

for ($row = 1; $row&lt; $iterations; $row++)
{
    $line = array();
    for($column = 0; $column &lt;= $row; $column++)
    {
         $first_number  = isset($rows[$row - 1 ][$column - 1 ]) ? $rows[$row - 1 ][$column - 1 ] : 0;
         $second_number = isset($rows[$row - 1 ][$column + 2 ]) ? $rows[$row - 1 ][$column + 2 ] : 0;

        $line[] = $first_number + $second_number;
    }
    $rows[] = $line;
}

foreach ($rows as $row)
{
    foreach ($row as $cell)
    {
        echo $cell."\t";
    }
    echo "\n";
}        

</code></pre>

<p>Okay, so this is all good and fine. You can draw a tree with circles and squares, and you can walk that tree to make a nice mountain picture. You can even manually calculate each possibilities, to a certain extent. Lovely. But what if I asked you to tell me how many different mountain pictures you could draw, with a tree of X nodes? How would you be able to tell me?</p>

<p>Or, perhaps I ask you to tell me what position of y you might be at, after you've "walked" 4 steps?</p>

<p>Sure, you could draw all of those mountains and walk all of those trees, but that sounds awfully tiring. It would be much better if you knew a formula to do that. Even better still if you could translate that formula into some code and make your computer do all the legwork, right?</p>

<p>Great, let's do that.</p>

<h4>These computes were made for walkin...</h4>

<p>There are some fairly famous numbers called Catalan numbers that are used to find the number of binary trees with N nodes. These numbers were defined by Eugene Charles Catalan[3] (he's a cool cat, you should look him up).</p>

<p>Catalan numbers are defined as follows:<br />
<img src="/img/catalan.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>For anyone who needs a refresher (I was completely lost here for a bit, so let me save you the trouble), the (2n n) is a binomial coefficient, which is calculated as follows:<br />
<img src="/img/bico.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>with n! denoting a factorial.</p>

<p>When you run that function for a given N, you're able to find out the number of binary trees with N many nodes. The sequence of those values are known as the Catalan numbers:  1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132.. etc etc etc.</p>

<p>Wait,... why am I talking about Catalan numbers? Those only apply to binary trees, and we're interested in ternary trees, right?  Well, you can generalize that catalan function to work for other trees as well!</p>

<p>That generalized function looks like this:<br />
<img src="/img/fuss-catalan.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Where x denotes the type of tree (1 for unary, 3 for ternary, etc) and n denotes the number of nodes we're asking about. If I want to know how many ternary trees with 4 internal nodes, I would do x = 3 (for ternary) and n = 4.  As promised, let's have our computer take care of the heavy lifting:</p>

<pre><code>$n = 4;
function ternary($n)
{
    return pow(((2*$n) + 1), -1) * binomialCoefficient((3*$n), $n);
}

echo ternary($n);
</code></pre>

<p>The answer? 55.</p>

<p>So, that's neat, and you can feel free to play around with it, popping in different values for x and n. But what about the sequence? There is a sequence of Catalan numbers corresponding to each n internal nodes on a binary tree. Can we do the same thing for our ternary trees? But of course we can!</p>

<p>The function to generate the sequence for ternary trees looks like this:<br />
<img src="/img/tofz.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Where t is the number denoting the type of tree (just like x did above), k is the number of "steps" you want to take (just like n above) and r is the number of trees you want to consider (yes, you can do more than one tree at a time).</p>

<pre><code>$t = 3;
$r = 1;
$k = 4;

$arr = array_fill(0, $k, 0);

$string_answer = "1 +";
foreach ($arr as $idx =&gt; $value)
{
    $i = $idx + 1;
    $n1 = ($t*$i) + $r;
    $n2 = $i;

    $bc = binomialCoefficient($n1, $n2);
    $answer = $bc * ($r/(($t*$i) +$r));

    $string_answer .= strval($answer)."z^".$i." + ";
}
</code></pre>

<p>What comes out?   <strong>1 + 1z<sup>1</sup> + 3z<sup>2</sup> + 12z<sup>3</sup> + 55z<sup>4</sup></strong><br />
You can see from this that the sequence of the first 4 numbers for ternary trees is: 1, 1, 3, 12, 55,</p>

<p>One last thing, the icing on the cake, if you will. Take a look back up at the table that we built earlier. You can see we only got 8 steps in manually, but if you run the code provided I took it out to 25 steps. Remove all of the zeroes, and then look at the left most column.</p>

<p>What do you see? 1, 1, 3, 12, 55. That looks familiar, doesn't it? That's because that column corresponds to the times when your walk ends at u<sup>0</sup> or y == 0. Recall that terniary trees are all <strong>excursions</strong> and must begin their walk at 0, and all of them must complete their walk at 0, and this makes perfect sense.</p>

<p>For a little extra<br />
<img src="http://i3.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/009/993/tumblr_m0wb2xz9Yh1r08e3p.jpg" alt="image" /><br />
The row second from the left corresponds to the sequence of numbers for <strong>B<sub>3</sub>(z)<sup>2</sup></strong> that is, squared ternary trees. The third row from the left corresponds to the cubed function, so on and so forth. You can use the code above to prove that, switching out the different numbers for r.</p>

            <link href="http://kayladnls.com/2014/12/11/machine-learning"/>
            <updated>2014-12-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>http://kayladnls.com/2014/12/11/machine-learning</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the first post in a new Machine Learning Series I'll be writing. We'll start from the top, covering what machine learning is at the most basic level. Each post will cover another topic, giving a more in depth view of key concepts and ideas.</p>

<h4>Machine Learning: What even is it?</h4>

<p>Machine learning. What do you think of when you hear that? If you're like most people (or at least like me) you think of SkyNet. Sentient computers that take over the world and enslave all of mankind.</p>

<p>Really, though, what Machine learning really is: MATH. Math, and magic and a whole lot of power. If you're already having horribly flashbacks to Calculus class, don't run away screaming just yet. Focus more on the "magic" and "power" parts. The math will come, I promise.</p>

<p>If you spend any time on the internet at all, you probably come into contact with dozens of services a day that use some form of machine learning. Do you use Gmail or a similar service that automatically detects "spam" for you and filters it out of your inbox? Are you on twitter right now, staring at a list of "Suggested" accounts for you to follow?</p>

<p>Both of those are examples of Machine Learning in action.</p>

<p>**Textbook Definition: **</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Machine learning is a scientific discipline that explores the construction and study of algorithms that can learn from data.[1]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Machine learning is about understanding data, and drawing conclusions from that data. There is a vast array of tools (algorithms) available to us to help us do that. The magic of these algorithms? They do all the work.</p>

<p>These algorithms are given a <strong>training dataset</strong> to learn from. Their accuracy is then run against a <strong>test dataset</strong> to confirm that they are performing well. Once that is done, you can feel relatively safe running the algorithm against real world data.</p>

<p>Think of both the training and test datasets as "past experiences". You're giving your algorithm a set of past experiences and telling it to learn from it. You can then hand it a "new experience", and based on what it has learned, it will predict the outcome for you.</p>

<h4>What can you do with it?</h4>

<p>There are two main types of Machine Learning (also called Statistical Learning): <strong>Supervised</strong> and <strong>Unsupervised</strong>.  I'll explain both breifly, and we'll go into more depth in future posts in this series.</p>

<h5>Supervised</h5>

<p>Supervised statistical learning methods build a statistical model for predicting or estimating output based on input(s). Within the field of supervised learning, there are two more clasifications: Those algorithms that give continuous,  quantitative output and those that give non-numeric or categorical (qualitative) output.</p>

<p>A common form of quantitative supervised learning is called <strong>Regression</strong>. 
**Example: **We have a dataset of <code>WageData</code> that includes information about the age, education, wage and calendar year of men in a specific area of the country. We can use a regression algorithm to create a model such that, given another man's information, we can accurately predict his wages.</p>

<p>A common form of qualitative supervised is <strong>Classification</strong>.<br />
<strong>Example:</strong> By examining stock market data containing daily movements in the S&amp;P 500 over a 5 year period, we are able to predict whether tomorrow's index will <em>increase</em> or <em>decrease</em>.  (PS: This is very hard to do, so don't get your hopes up that this series will teach you to become a Wall Street bajillionaire.)</p>

<h5>Unsupervised</h5>

<p>Unsupervised methods have input, but no output. Instead, we're trying to learn about the structure of the data, and relationships within that data. In this case, we're not trying to predict or estimate, but observe.</p>

<p>A common type of Unsupervised learning is called <strong>Clustering</strong>. 
<strong>Example</strong> Given market demographics for customers of our company (age, Annual house hold income, etc) we can analyze the data and find "groupings" or "clusters" within the data. Further analysis of those clusters can help us understand how each group is related to the other.</p>

<p>So, there you have it. A quick, preliminary rundown of what Machine Learning is. More to come!</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h4>"Have you ever heard of Rule 30?"</h4>

<p>A friend chirped me in skype asking if I was familiar with "Rule 30". He's going in for a job interview and they'd asked him to code this Rule 30 as an exercise. I hadn't heard of it, but I was intruiged, and I'm always one to try to help a friend. Off to the Google-Mobile, Batman!</p>

<p>As I would learn, <code>Rule 30</code> refers to something introduced by  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Wolfram">Stephen Wolfram</a> in 1983]<sup> (1)</sup>.  Even if you're not familiar with Wolfram, you're probably familiar with his work. Especially, if you took any <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/">college level Calculus classes</a>. He was a computer scientist, and word is he was pretty good at the maths. If you don't know him, check him out, cool dude.</p>

<p>Anyway, on to this Rule 30 business. Rule 30 is one of many rules that pertains to binary cellular automaton<sup> (2)</sup>. Now, when I read that the first time, they lost me halfway through binary. If you're like me, never fear!</p>

<h4>Elementary Celluar Automaton</h4>

<p>So, how's this work? For each cell there are two possible values: 1 or 0. Each of Wolfram's "Rules" (there are 255 of them) defines a list of rules that tell you how to determine whether a given cell is 1 or 0. It does this by analyzing the "neghborhood" of the cell in question. What is meant by neighborhood is discussed in more detail below.</p>

<h4>What it means to be 1D</h4>

<p>You may be famliar with other Cellular Automata, such as Conway's game of life Game of Life<sup>(3)</sup>. This method is similar, but there is a primary difference. Game of Life is 2-dimensional, with a third dimension of time. That means that as the rules are applied and the pattern progresses, the "board" is refreshed.</p>

<p>Rule 30 and it's siblings are 1-Dimensional. In this case, the y axis is, in fact, time. That means that as the program is run the new output is appended to the old, rather than the entire "board" refreshing.</p>

<h4>Why "Rule 30"?</h4>

<p>Since there are<code>2×2×2 = 8</code> possible binary states for the three cells neighboring a given cell, there are a total of <code>2^8=256</code> elementary cellular automata, each of which can be indexed with an 8-bit binary number.</p>

<p>So, Binary: 00011110 = decimal 30. Therefore, Rule 30. This holds true for all of the other rules, too, by the way. Not terribly important, but I found it interesting, so there you have it. Moving on.</p>

<h4>Ruleception</h4>

<p>Yes! Rules inside rules!</p>

<p><img src="/img/rule30.gif" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Above are the rules given for Rule 30. This is how you determine whether your "cell" is a 1 or a 0. Upon first inspection, this made absolutely 0 sense to me. (binary pun possibly intended?).</p>

<p>What you need to understand here is what is meant by "neighborhood". When you're determining the 1/0ness of a cell, you look at it's neighborhood and compare that against the rules. Neighborhood being the three cells above it. So, 111 = 0, 110 = 0, so forth and so on. Once you get your mind around that, you're off to the races.</p>

<p>Once you have your rules, you apply them to the given input (in this case a single "line" of the grid with at least one cell set to "1"). What do you get?</p>

<p><img src="/img/rule30graph.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>So Pretty.</p>

<p>But how do you DO it? Well, let me show you.</p>

<h4>The Codez.</h4>

<p>*** Warning!** I have absolutely no intention of using OO practices here. No classes will be made, no injection will be used. I will interface nothing. If this makes you uncomfortable, you may want to stop reading.*</p>

<p>End result, I want to create this cool looking graph thing. That's how a picture it, a graph, or grid, Once you're there, it becomes a matter of some setup, and then some iteration. It looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>//First thing's first, let's codify those rules. 
$rules = array(
    '111'=&gt; 0,
    '110' =&gt; 0,
    '101'=&gt; 0,
    '100' =&gt; 1,
    '011'=&gt; 1,
    '010' =&gt; 1,
    '001'=&gt; 1,
    '000' =&gt; 0
);

//create an empty array to hold your grid
$lines = array();

//set up that first line 
$first_line = array_fill(0, 51, 0);

// make sure you set at least one of those cells to 1,
// or this will going no where fase. 
$first_line[24] = 1;

//now add your line to the grid. 
$lines[] = $first_line;

//Lets compile that grid

// I'm doing 10 iterations, you can do as many as you like. 
for ($i = 0; $i&lt; 10; $i++)
{
    // make a new line
    $line = array();

    for($j = 0; $j&lt; 51; $j++)
    {
        // The "pattern" is determined by the "neighborhood" or the 3 cells in the 
        // generation (row) above our cell in question. 
        $pattern = (string)implode('', array_slice(end($lines), $j - 1, 3));

         // if we have a valid value, great. Elsewise, give is a 0. 
         $line[] = (strlen($pattern) == 3 &amp;&amp; isset($rules[$pattern])) ? $rules[$pattern] : 0;
    }

    Add the new line into the grid
    $lines[] = $line;
}

// Now, let's output it
foreach ($lines as $line)
{
    foreach ($line as $piece)
    {
        echo $piece;
    }
    echo "\n";
}
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/img/rule30output.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Tada!</p>

<h4>Merry Christmas!</h4>

<p>For mine, I changed 1 to <code>'/'</code> and 0 to <code>'*'</code>. Why? Because it's December, and it looks festive, that's why. I just taught you how to output a Christmas tree in your terminal!</p>

<p>Clearly, with the added nerdery, this is no longer a Christmas Tree. This is what we call a FSM Tree. The perfect DIY gift for your budget conscious nerd.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.giphy.com/media/14cUTtBgAXn7J6/giphy.gif" alt="image" /></p>

<p>And there you have it. Merry Christmas, Nerds.</p>

<h4>Post Script</h4>

<p>You may be wondering why the post title references Turing completeness<sup>(4)</sup>. As I mentioned before, our beloved Rule 30 has 254 siblings. One of these siblings is known as Rule 110, and this rule is turing complete.</p>

<p>The process for running through Rule 110 is the same as Rule 30 (that holds true for all 255 rules, by the by), the only change is the rules. So, if you're interested, here are the rules for Rule 110 (in Christmas tree format, of course)</p>

<pre><code>$rules = array(
    '///'=&gt; '*',
    '//*' =&gt; '/',
    '/*/'=&gt; '/',
    '/**' =&gt;'*',
    '*//'=&gt; '/',
    '*/*' =&gt; '/',
    '**/'=&gt; '/',
    '***' =&gt; '*'
);
</code></pre>

<p>Go forth and make a Turing machine.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Ending the stigma.</h3>

<p>When you open up a story on Medium (for those of you who’ve never used it), the ghost prompt says “Tell your story..”</p>

<p>I’ve been staring at those words for five minutes now, not really reading them. It wasn’t until they finally registered that I knew what I needed to say here.</p>

<p>I want to talk about depression, but it’s difficult. It’s crazy difficult. And to talk about it in a personal sense? A sense that relates to my personal experiences? That’s almost impossible.</p>

<p>But it needs to not be impossible. It needs to be okay.</p>

<p>I was 13 when I tried to kill myself for the first time. I’ll never forget that day. I took a bottle of aspirin over the kitchen sink. I don’t remember wanting to die, or knowing that I was killing myself. I’d stayed home from school sick that day. I wasn’t really sick, I just didn’t feel like being around anyone outside of my own skin. I had a headache, and I went to the kitchen. I remember the aspirin (it was the generic uncoated kind) turning into mush in my mouth. I couldn’t swallow it all, and it tasted to vile. I coughed up a bunch and got a glass of water to swallow the rest down.</p>

<p>The next few hours of my life were a horrible, wretched, world spinning ride of nausea and pain. My parents came home, and they knew immediately something was wrong. My dad got me to throw up, and then the pain stopped. I remember throwing up pieces of my stomach lining, and my dad crying. I think he cried, anyway. I cried.</p>

<p>A year and a half later, I was diagnosed with depression and bipolar disorder, after being sexually abused.</p>

<p>I started smoking, and I started cutting. I have 13 scars up my right arm, including very crummily etched letters that spell “Fuck”. There are a few scars on my shoulder, too, and one on the inside of my wrist. I remember taking just enough aspirin to make the world spin and wash, but not enough to die. I wanted to die, and I hated myself for being too much of a coward to do it.</p>

<p>With my diagnosis came a prescription for Zoloft. But, when I looked at those little orange bottles, I didn’t see a way to get healthy, or any help for me. I saw a label, plastered across my face, that said I was sick. There was something WRONG with me, and I had to be fixed.</p>

<p>I didn’t take those pills. I stockpiled them, and eventually, I swallowed two bottles at once. I got my stomach pumped that day.</p>

<p>Eventually, I decided I wasn’t sick. Fuck being sick. Fuck being broken. I’m not that. I resolved to never take one of those pills ever again. I left highschool and went to college. I got pregnant, I had a daughter. I got married, and then divorced. I moved to the big city, I got married again, I had two boys, I finished school, I became a successful developer. I love my job, and I love my family, and most days, I love my life.</p>

<p>But here’s the truth: I can’t count the number of times I’ve wanted to die. I can’t count the number of times that I’ve sat alone and cried, because I couldn’t think of a single happy thing. Sometimes, I can’t think of anything at all, just an expansive nothingness. It eats at you, and if you let it, it will consume you.</p>

<p>I’m afraid to let everyone know. What if they don’t think I’m okay to do my job, once they know? What if my “successfull” career falls to shambles, because they think there’s something wrong with me? What if they take my kids because I’m sick? What if they judge me?</p>

<p>I’ve tried to tell people a few people close to me, but they shake their heads. They don’t believe me. When I was a kid, it was easy to see how messed up I was. I was slicing my arm to pieces, for Christ’s sake. But now; now I”m successful. Now, I’m a good mother and a good wife, and I have a successful career. There’s no way that I’m sick. They don’t believe it.</p>

<p>Today, reality came crashing in. Someone many people knew and loved died because of this disease, and hundreds of thousands of others have died before him. So here I am: I’m sick, and I hurt, and my hurt is no less real than if I were bleeding.</p>

<p>It’s odd to me, that I feel GUILTY for being sick. You don’t feel guilty for getting the flu, or pnuemonia, or cancer. Those are things that happen TO you, but for some reason, we’ve all decided that depression and mental illness are somehow our fault. Like I could have done something to stop it, or solve it.</p>

<p>I couldn’t. I can’t. I am me. I am beautiful, and funny and brilliant and successful. I am a good mother, and a good wife, and I have depression.</p>

<p>I don’t want your pity. I’d like support, and more than anything, I’d like awareness. I’d like to live in a world, where I can say, “Hey, I’m bipolar” without people looking at me like I’m a leper. I’d like to know that generations that come after us won’t be judged, or scared, or guilty, for having this sickness. One where they can seek help as easily and freely as people do when they have readily visible illnesses.</p>

<p>I have tweeted, and I will be tweeting once a day: my diagnosis, along with #endthestigma. If you’re willing to share yours, do. A simple tweet diagnosis and the hashtag. If you’re not, then feel free to retweet mine. More people need to know that it’s okay. That it will be okay.</p>

<p>And if anyone feels the way I have felt in the past, reach out. I will listen, always. I don’t care if I know you, or I don’t. I don’t care what time it is, or where I am. I have my cell phone on always, if you need someone to talk to, message me. Just say “Kayla, I need help.” You’ll have my full attention, I promise.</p>

            <link href="http://kayladnls.com/2014/07/07/stop-letting-numbers-define-you"/>
            <updated>2014-07-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>http://kayladnls.com/2014/07/07/stop-letting-numbers-define-you</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My mom is in town this week, and on her last day here, we decided to go clothes shopping. She found a few shirts that I adored, and offered to pick them up for me. I grabbed my customary ‘M’ off the rack and started to leave.</p>

<p>I stopped myself just short, staring down at the shirts in my hand. “Yeah, I should probably try those on.”</p>

<p>It was good that I did, because my customary ‘M’ reduced me to a sausage. Time to move up to the new customary “L”. I switched the shirts, and we made for the register. Except, as we walked, and she made joyful small talk, I felt like I wanted to cry. Like I’d been punched in the gut. I felt miserable.</p>

<p>It’s the same way I felt upon realizing recently that I have two pairs of jeans left that fit comfortably. The same way I feel whenever I step on the scale. I weigh about 180lbs right now, give or take a few ounces. It’s the same amount I weighed when I gave birth to each of my sons. I’ve officially gone up a size and about 15lbs in the past year.</p>

<p>I came to terms with the fact that I will never be a size 0 a long time ago. At nearly six foot tall, it is literally impossible for me. However, I still can’t handle going up a size. “I used to be a nine!”, I say. Single digits! That was awesome. And here I am, back in a size twelve. This is not awsome.</p>

<p>When I feel like this, my inner pep talk kicks in. I tell myself: “Girl, you’ve had three kids. Give yourself a break”. Or “There are too many things in this world worth eating to be skinny. Eat all the things”. Or, my favorite “You’re beautiful on the inside. You’re smart and your funny, and you’re nice. That’s enough”.</p>

<p>You know what, pep talk voice in my head that’s trying in vain to make me feel better and is really only succeeding in making me feel worse? I have something to say to you: Go straight to hell. You, and the feelings that bring you out, can go jump in a big lake of fire. Feel free to take the media industry that conditions little girls to strive for flat stomachs and huge tits right along with you.</p>

<p>Cause here’s the thing. All of those pep talk things are true. There IS a plethora of amazing food out there, just waiting to be devoured, and I really enjoy devouring it (Not to mention beer. Don’t get me started on beer). I AM a nice person. I’m generally kind, and honest. I tell a hell of a joke. I’m a wonderful mother, and yes, my body has brought three amazing little people into this world. Those three people are also kind, and honest, and incredibly funny, in part due to me. More than any of that: I am happy. As a person who hasn’t spent a good percentage of her life being happy, happiness is golden.</p>

<p>Maybe (probably) I should feel guilty because I spend more time working, and mothering, and yes, eating, and not enough time exercising. But these are choices I’ve made, these are priorities I’ve set. I should be able to own those things, and the bigger clothes those choices bring, without this deep nagging feeling of self loathing.</p>

<p>I should worry about my weight because of my health, or because of the example I set for my children. I should NOT worry about my weight because of what size some yahoo at the clothing company decided to throw on a label or where the dial stops when I step on a scale. Because neither of those numbers define me. Neither of those numbers will make me any happier than I am now.</p>

<p>And really, possibly the hardest thing for me to accept: Neither of those numbers will make me any more attractive. I felt ugly and miserable at a size nine. So, no, it wasn’t really that awesome, no matter how much I tell myself it was. I feel ugly and miserable at a size 12. The size doesn’t change how I feel.</p>

<p>Being happy, though.. that changes everything. I feel beautiful when I’m playing outside with my kids. I feel like a rockstar when I serve them a great meal. I feel great when I make someone smile. And when I’m smiling, I couldn’t give a damn about how I look.</p>

<p>The Truth: I am the most attractive when I’m happy. When I’m smiling. When there are absolutely no fucks given over what size my damned jeans are.</p>

<p>So, from me to you, Pep-Talk Voice: Fuck you. Fuck the excuses I make to myself to explain away why I’m gaining weight. I don’t need excuses. I don’t need permission to gain weight, not even from myself. I DO need to be happy. I DO need to own my choices and either be okay with them, or change them.</p>

<p>I DID need to write this, so thanks for reading.</p>

            <link href="http://kayladnls.com/2014/05/24/code-manifesto"/>
            <updated>2014-05-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>http://kayladnls.com/2014/05/24/code-manifesto</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago I wrote a blog post venting my frustrations with the current state of the tech industry, specifically related to how women are treated in the field. It wasn’t terribly rational. I was complaining, and I had no solutions to offer on the matter.</p>

<p>I’ve had a lot of good conversations about the issue since. I’ve spoken with people who agree, who kind of agree, and a few who completely disagree. It’s forced me to sit down and analyze my thoughts. To really solidify what I saw as the problem, and possible ways of approaching it. In short, I’ve learned a lot.</p>

<p>First: I would like to address the things I said about women’s outreach programs. I originally found such groups/classes/etc patronizing and exclusionary. Turns out, they are neither. From what I’ve learned, these groups aren’t “PHP for women and women only” more like “PHP for people who aren’t misogynistic jerks”. There might be a bit of a messaging disconnect there. They’re aiming to create a safe, welcoming place for women to exist in our industry. I think that’s great.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>This isn’t a women’s issue. It’s an everyone issue.</h3>
</blockquote>

<p>Second: This isn’t a women’s issue. It’s a minorities issue. Really, it’s an everyone issue. I had the pleasure of speaking with an Italian developer who’s felt and seen treatment similar to what I’ve experienced, simply because English isn’t his native language.</p>

<p>Here’s where I ended up: The industry I work in now is not the industry that I want to work in. I love what I do for a living. I love a great many of the people I’ve met while doing that thing that I love to do. I don’t love being treated like an outsider. I don’t love feeling like I don’t, or can’t have a voice. I don’t love seeing other people treated like that.</p>

<p>I want to work in an industry that is welcoming and empowering. I want people outside our industry to look in and see a place where people, all people, regardless of their demographics, are able to do great things. A place that is supportive and helpful. The more people we have doing what we do, the more brains we have in the room, solving the problems that we’re solving, the better off we’re all going to be.</p>

<p>For all we know, there’s a girl who’s written the code to solve the same problem you’ve been beating your head against your keyboard over for months. Except, it’s sitting on her hard drive somewhere, because she’s too scared of being judged, or she doesn’t feel confident enough to share it. Empower that girl. In short, empower all the people.</p>

<p>There’s no overnight fix for this. There is no switch we can flip and correct it, no algorithm that can be written to magically make everyone get along. We do have the power to fix it, though. Each of us, incrementally, iteratively. People have power. A giant organism can be changed, simply by transforming each of the tiny molecules that make up that organism. Similarly, our community as a whole can be changed, if each of us vows to change it. It will take time, but it’s something well worth undertaking.</p>

<p>To this end, I came up with the Code Manifesto. It is simply a list of values. If each of us committed ourselves to upholding these values, the space in which we work would be a better place to be. The list is in no way comprehensive. It is very much a work in progress, and I’d love to see input from the community. It’s on github, and pull requests are welcome. Add to it, modify it, make it something that each of us can stand for and be proud to represent.</p>

<p>I had the amazing opportunity to give a lightening talk at Laracon in NYC last week. I chose to talk about the Manifesto, what it is, and what brought it on.</p>

<p>This was my first conference, and my first time talking in front of that many people. It was, hands down, one of the scariest things I’ve ever done, and also one of the most gratifying. I stood on a brightly lit stage, in front of roughly 280 of my peers and explained how and why I felt things are broken. And also what I think we can do to fix them.</p>

<p>I spoke for about fifteen minutes. My voice broke a few times. My palms were sweating, and I was really worried that the things I was saying were silly. But I stood up there, and I said what I came to say.</p>

<p>And then they clapped, and all the fear melted away. Stepping off that stage I felt high. Maybe higher than I’ve ever felt. Sliding back into my chair afterwards and seeing the response on twitter brought a tear to my eye. A few of them, to be honest.</p>

<p>For the next day and a half people came up to me as I walked around the conference to thank me, to tell me that they agree. They wanted to talk about the issues we’re all facing, and discuss what we can do to fix them. Men and women alike were talking about it. They were on board. It was, and still is, surreal. But it gives me hope. Hope that people not only see the problem, but that they want to fix it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>It gives me hope that this can be fixed.</h3>

            <updated>2014-05-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>http://kayladnls.com/2014/05/01/not-a-shiny-unicorn</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>The life and times of a girl developer</h2>

<p>I’m a web developer, application architect, builder of things or just general nerd. I also happen to be the proud owner of a vagina (or as I recently learned, a growler. I guess it’s a British thing).</p>

<p>Somehow, being the former and having the latter means I am some kind of oddity. I’ve been met with skepticism, mistrust, and probably the most insulting reaction; complete shock and awe.</p>

<p>It’s bothered me forever, and I think I can finally put it into words.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>I am not a bloody unicorn.</h2>
</blockquote>

<p>Please, stop offering me grants, scholarships, job offers, special courses, conferences, books, blog posts, or any other kind of annoying, passive condescension based solely on the fact that I am a girl. Never, for any reason append any professional compliment with “..for a girl” (yes, this has happened). Don’t tell me I’m the “best female” anything.</p>

<p>If I’m offered something, I want it to be because of my accomplishments, and not my sex. I can guarantee you my lack of a Y chromosome has exactly nothing to do with my ability or lack there of. If I suck, tell me. I can take it, I promise.</p>

<p>Bottom line: Girls aren’t any different. We’re different because people keep making us different. Most of these people are well intentioned; they’re trying to help, and I do appreciate the thought. But it’s not helping.</p>

<p>Treating women as if we need extra help, or an extra push or an extra anything doesn’t broadcast to the community as a whole that we are just as capable as our male counterparts. No, it says that we need just a little bit more something to get to the places and do the things that men are able to do on their own.</p>

<p>I have an AS in computer science. I studied C++ and some Java in school, and today I’m a PHP developer. All the PHP I know I taught myself via books, online resources, reading the documentation, etc. So, I feel that I’ve gotten a pretty good overview of the kinds of resources that are available to novice developers trying to scrape together some semblance of a skill set.</p>

<p>Never in all that roaming of the world wide interwebs have I seen a course titled “HTML5 for men” or a summer retreat workshop called “BoyCode”. I’ve never seen GingerCode, either, for that matter. In fact, the only demographic specification I’ve seen in resources is directed at women. It doesn’t make sense to me.</p>

<p>I’ve nearly written this a number a times, and stopped myself. The whole thing sounds a little #firstworldproblems. Essentially, I’m complaining about people creating too many resources targeted at me, which might be a foolish things to bitch about.</p>

<p>I think it’s more than that, though. I recently listened to Jeffrey Way on the LaravelIO Podcast talking about Imposter Syndrome. The whole time he was describing it, I was emphatically nodding along. That’s how I feel. All. The. Time. After that episode, I had to look it up.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Impostor syndrome is a psychological phenomenon in which people are unable to internalize their accomplishments. Despite external evidence they remain convinced that they are frauds and do not deserve the success they have achieved. Proof of success is dismissed as luck, timing, or as a result of deceiving others into thinking they are more intelligent and competent than they believe themselves to be.
  I’ve heard a lot of developers say they feel this way. Developers that I look up to, who I know are good at what they do. This is in no way something is isolated to women, but I think the kinds of targeted resources that are pointed at girls could contribute to or intensify it for girls. For me personally, I think it’s a factor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This whole rant seems a bit hypocritical considering I recently toyed with the idea of creating a web site focused on Laravel outreach for women. I’ve gotten really into Laravel lately, and it’s a bit early, but I think I’m in love. I want to shout about the greatness of this tool from the tops of mountains and talk about it with anyone or anything that has ears (and I frequently do).</p>

<p>I noticed that I wasn’t seeing any other girls in the community. I’m tired of sitting in rooms full of men and feeling out of place. I know other women are out there, I know they’re building awesome stuff. But prevailingly, the loudest voices are male ones.</p>

<p>I did a little outreach to other female laravel devs to get their opinion, and they responded with words that just as likely could have fallen from my lips if someone other than myself had asked me what I thought of the idea. There were a few positives, but most of them were something along the lines of “Seriously? Really? Why?”</p>

<p>Immediately I felt the wonderful kind of self loathing that can only happen when you realize that you’ve become something that you hate. I was trying to build the same kind of platform I groan and roll my eyes at. There has to be a better answer.</p>

<p>If there’s an answer to the problem, I haven’t found it yet, but I’m still looking. If you find it before I do, feel free to let me know.</p>
